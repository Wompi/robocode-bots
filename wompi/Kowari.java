// TODO: use the DIR variable as lastHitTime and make it changed for a needs
// initialize the variable with 30 - just a thought to prevent the first hit issu  

// TODO: rethink about the new movement
// the movement should work with facing to the enemy and if he shoots move to him and turn perpendicuar i
// if he shoots again move back to the facing position with some luck it can dodge 
// linear and headon in one catch a well thought sin period should do the trick

// TODO: have a closer look at the gun - sounds promising to alternate between HoT and linear
// maybe adjust the factor in onHit and onMiss
// otherwise adjust the overall factor like the speed variable dependent where he stays and what the 
// hit bounds is

// TODO: the distance 160 should be adjusted to the current bullet power of the enemies gun heating
// well that means he shoots 3.0 stay 16*11=176 pixel away (16 heat, 11 bullet speed) if he shoots 0.1 stay
// 11*19.7=216.7 pixel away - this would mean he can always have only one bullet at the time in the air and you 
// can dodge it way better. My thought so far it would be good to find a divisor where the distance 
// bullet ticks is a min and you can oscillate between these parameters - this need a lot more research
//setTurnRightRadians(Math.cos(e.getBearingRadians() - ((e.getDistance() - 160) * dir * 0.0024)));
//setTurnRightRadians(Math.cos(e.getBearingRadians() - e.getDistance() * getVelocity() / 2500));
//double turn = Math.cos(e.getBearingRadians());
//double offset = - (e.getDistance() - /*Rules.getBulletSpeed(ePower) * Rules.getGunHeat(ePower) * 10*/250)
//* getVelocity() * ADVANCE_FACTOR

// TODO: change the direction dependent on the fire frequency 
// that means he shoots 3.0 = 16 ticks so head(sin(time * pi/(16-2))) would do the trick
// you have to maintain the time variable 0 on every shoot and ++ on every turn this will oscillate the bot
// every 14 tick - the -2 is just an offset to hit the break if near the time he can next shoot
// maybe it is possible to use the getTime() and modulo for this kind of stuff
// i guess this will bring a nice touch to the movement and can avoid a couple of scenarios 

// TODO: this concept should go to a micro bot - periodic direction change dependent on enemy gun heat  
//eHeat = Math.ceil((Rules.getGunHeat(absBearing) / getGunCoolingRate())) - 1 - 4;

// Note: before i forget this stuff
// this is the simplified math from Narbalek and means 
// speed = 2*d0 / tick
// tick = eDist / (20-3*bPower)
// with d0 = 25 to 27 (this is the distance to the line that hits the far corner of our bot)
// tick - is the time the enemy bullet needs to hit the bot at its current position
// if you transform the formula you get the cryptic monster below
// the whole idea is to move the bot with the calculated speed just enough to dodge any
// HoT shooting. He moves barely out of the former position where the speed is LOW if far away 
// and HIGH if near

// TODO: the bounce angle for wall hits is significant for HoT hits... if you drive perenticular to the bot
// you got least hits but can stuck in corners

//setMaxVelocity((1080 - 162 * ePower) / e.getDistance() + SPEEDUP_FACTOR / ++speedUp);
//setMaxVelocity(54 * e.getDistance() / Rules.getBulletSpeed(ePower) + SPEEDUP_FACTOR / ++speedUp); // grr 1 byte shorter
//setAhead(Math.sin(getTime() * Math.PI / 16) * Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);

// TODO: the hit time can be used in some kind of standard deviation look at the difference between
// bullet turns and hits - if it is 1 or 2 of it means the bullet has hit you right after each other
// if the difference is bigger you can guess the frequency of the hitting and make your decision from there
// this is very basic tested so far but i have a hunch it could work
